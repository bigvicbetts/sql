# Had to create the "starter table" that Amir had created for us previously.  I created it exactly as he had,
# including the order in which I entered the students so that they had the same ID's.  That way, the rest of
# the exercise was simply copying over the script that I had from the initial exercise.  Work smarter, not harder.
